Quick notes about BBB testing
-----------------------------

Booting from SDCard:

The BBB is designed with a button that can be pressed to force SDcard booting. In our setup,
this button is held down everytime. We can easily make U-Boot on the SDcard boot into the
internal OS by resetting the uenvcmd variable. At execution time, the test script makes
sure it's starting from the internal OS, if it isnt, it sets the uenvcmd mentioned above
and reboots the device.


Connectivity with internal network

The communication between the BBB and the build machine are via rSSH, and rely on a
public facing machine. I use my own public machine @ wmd.no for this, and it's already
setup to accept the keys found in keys.tar.gz The BBB connects using the keys found
in the keys.tar.gz.gpg, I (Greg) have the symmetric key to decrypt this file. Everything
the BBB can boot into requires that a SSH tunnel is established, so: rssh.service, and
the keys must be copied over before booting.
The internal OS on the emmc, the sdimg, and the update image all use this.
